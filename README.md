This project will demonstrate one simple data analysis for crowdfunding dataset. This data analysis has following details

1. Reading dataset
2. Vidualizing the dataset
3. Data cleaning
4. Normalize the categorical and continuous data
5. Finding best features for model training

After the data is cleaned and features are found, following are the models are implemented

1. Tensorflow Model
2. Simple MLP model
3. Random Forest
4. Using Keras sequential model
5. PCA

And their comparisons.
